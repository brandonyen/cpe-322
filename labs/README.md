# CPE 322 Labs

As a replacement for the labs, I decided to work on a project that is personally relevant to me. To scout information about players in the MOBA League of Legends, you would normallly use a site like op.gg or u.gg. I decided to replicate these kinds of sites by using the Riot Games API. More details and run instructions can be found in the scout-gg folder.
